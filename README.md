401(k) Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling
This project explores 401(k) participation patterns through comprehensive data analysis, predictive modeling, and clustering techniques. By analyzing key factors influencing employee engagement in retirement plans, the project provides actionable insights to help employers optimize 401(k) participation.

Key Objectives:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified key factors influencing 401(k) participation, such as income, education, and marital status.
Predictive Modeling: Built Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models, achieving up to 97% recall and an AUC of 97%. These models reveal the most significant drivers of participation.
Clustering Analysis: Utilized KMeans and DBSCAN clustering to segment participants based on demographic and financial profiles, providing insights for targeted strategy formulation.

Key Results:
Predictive Models: Logistic Regression performed with a recall of 97% and AUC of 97%, identifying income and 401(k) eligibility as top drivers.
Clustering: Segmented participants into distinct groups, revealing different behaviors related to retirement plan engagement.
Actionable Insights: Recommendations focus on improving participation rates by targeting key demographics such as education level, income bracket, and marital status.

Technologies Used:
Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn)
Machine Learning: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
Clustering: KMeans, DBSCAN
Visualization: Seaborn, Matplotlib
